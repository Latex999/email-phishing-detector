Hi,

I need you to process an urgent wire transfer for a new vendor we're working with on the confidential acquisition project. This needs to be completed today.

Amount: $47,850.00
Recipient: Strategic Consulting LLC
Account Number: 45781299
Routing: 072156324
Bank: First National Bank
Reference: Project Jupiter - Q1 2024

Please keep this confidential as per our NDA with the vendor. I'm in meetings all day and cannot be reached by phone, so please confirm by email when the transfer is complete.

Thanks for handling this quickly.

Regards,
John Smith
CEO
